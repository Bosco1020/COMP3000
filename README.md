## Project Vision:
Smart Heart is a Heart simulation application with the purpose of demonstrating the possibilities of using game development technologies in science. It's designed for professionals in various industries to learn and see how utilising the various tools and techniques from game development can create more efficient and usable simulations. Using a heart attack as an example, Smart Heart is a proof of concept, containing various collections of cells in the Heart and showing their responses to a blockage in a small Artery (Arteriole). The system used is modularly designed, so that all the components can be easily added to, edited, removed or created anew without changing any code. By taking advantage of the game engines built in tools, along with considering good practices with data management, Smart Heart uses object pooling with scriptable objects as the foundation for its efficient and scalable design. Only the minimum amount of data required is saved and only when needed.
