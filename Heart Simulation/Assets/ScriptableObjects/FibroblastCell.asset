  defaultText: Cardiac Fibroblasts help maintain the extracellular matrix, the fluid
    around the cells. There is still a lot of research into learning more about them
    and their methods of response.

    text: Triggered by the death of nearby cells, Fibroblasts absorb contents from
      dying muscle, endothelial and other cells to turn into Myofibroblasts. These
      cells produce collagen fibres to form a scar over the dead zone.
